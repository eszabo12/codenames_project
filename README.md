 - This is my attempt at creating a multiagent codenames AI. to run the model:


pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 codenames.py fasttext

 - (You may have to wait a couple of minutes for the millions of embedding vectors to be read in)
 - In order to run the multiagent file, similarly run
python3 multiagent.py fasttext
